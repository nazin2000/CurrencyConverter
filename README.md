Project Overview: 
This Currency Converter project was developed using Java during my Object Oriented Programming course in the fourth semester at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The project allows users to easily convert between different currencies by using real-time or manually input exchange rates, with a focus on applying object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Features
Currency Selection: Users can select from a variety of currencies to convert between.
Real-Time Exchange Rate: Optional integration of APIs for real-time currency conversion rates (can be manually input for testing purposes).
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation.
Error Handling: Input validation to ensure only valid amounts are converted.
OOP Principles: The project showcases Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Development Environment:Eclipse
